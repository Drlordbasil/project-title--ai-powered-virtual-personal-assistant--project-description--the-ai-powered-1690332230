* Commit 1: Refactor the script to use a class -based structure for better organization and encapsulation of functionality.
- Create a new file called `assistant.py`.
- Move the existing code into a class called `Assistant`.
- Add an `__init__` method to initialize the `recognizer` and `microphone` objects.
- Move the `listen`, `speak`, `greet_user`, `send_email`, `process_command`, and `run` methods into the class .
- Remove the `import ` statements for `smtplib`, `webbrowser`, `datetime`, `pyttsx3`, and `speech_recognition`.
- Update the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block to instantiate an instance of the `Assistant` class and call the `run` method.

* Commit 2: Improve error handling in the `listen` method.
- Wrap the code inside the `with self.microphone as source` block in a try -except block.
- Catch the `sr.UnknownValueError` exception and print a helpful error message.
- Catch the `sr.RequestError` exception and print a helpful error message.

* Commit 3: Use a `with ` statement when sending emails with `smtplib` for proper cleanup.
- Wrap the `smtplib.SMTP` connection in a `with ` statement.
    - Move the existing code that logs in , sends the email, and closes the connection inside the `with` block.

* Commit 4: Encourage passing email sender credentials as arguments to the `run` method instead of hardcoding them.
- Remove the hardcoded email and password from the `run` method arguments.
- Update the `run` method to accept `sender_email` and `sender_password` as arguments.
- Replace the hardcoded email and password in the `run` method call in the `__main__` block with actual email and password values.

* Commit 5: Add exception handling for web browser opening and file execution.
- Wrap the `webbrowser.open` and `os.startfile` calls in try -except blocks.
- Catch any exceptions that may occur and print a helpful error message.

* Commit 6: Implement additional features like playing music, setting reminders, or fetching information from APIs.
- Add new methods to the `Assistant` class for each additional feature.
- Implement the functionality for each feature in its respective method.

* Commit 7: Create separate functions or methods for each command in the `process_command` method.
- Refactor the `process_command` method by creating separate methods for each command.
- Update the `process_command` method to call the appropriate method based on the command.

* Commit 8: Implement error handling for the email sending process.
- Add additional error handling code to validate email addresses, check network connectivity, and handle other potential errors.
- Print helpful error messages for each specific error scenario.

Remember to periodically update the email sending mechanism to use secure authentication methods if applicable.
