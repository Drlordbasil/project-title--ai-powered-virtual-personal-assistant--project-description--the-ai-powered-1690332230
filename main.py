Here's an improved version of the Python program:

```python


class Assistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
        self.microphone = sr.Microphone()

    def listen(self):
        with self.microphone as source:
            print("Listening...")
            self.recognizer.pause_threshold = 1
            audio = self.recognizer.listen(source)

        try:
            print("Recognizing...")
            query = self.recognizer.recognize_google(audio, language='en')
            print(f"User said: {query}\n")
            return query.lower()
        except sr.UnknownValueError:
            print("I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Can you please repeat?")
        except sr.RequestError:
            print("Sorry, I am unable to access the speech recognition service.")
        return None

    def speak(self, text):
        engine = pyttsx3.init()
        engine.say(text)
        engine.runAndWait()

    def greet_user(self):
        hour = int(datetime.datetime.now().hour)

        if hour < 12:
            self.speak("Good morning!")
        elif 12 <= hour < 18:
            self.speak("Good afternoon!")
        else:
            self.speak("Good evening!")

        self.speak("How can I assist you today?")

    def send_email(self, to, subject, body, sender_email, sender_password):
        try:
            with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as server:
                server.ehlo()
                server.starttls()
                server.login(sender_email, sender_password)
                message = f"Subject: {subject}\n\n{body}"
                server.sendmail(sender_email, to, message)
            self.speak("Email has been sent successfully!")
        except Exception as e:
            print(str(e))
            self.speak("Sorry, I am unable to send the email at the moment.")

    def process_command(self, command, sender_email, sender_password):
        if "open" in command:
            if "browser" in command:
                webbrowser.open("https://www.google.com")
            elif "calculator" in command:
                os.startfile("calc.exe")
            elif "notepad" in command:
                os.startfile("notepad.exe")
            else:
                self.speak("Sorry, I don't know how to open that application.")
        elif "tell me the time" in command:
            current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M")
            self.speak(f"The current time is {current_time}")
        elif "send email" in command:
            self.speak("To whom should I send the email?")
            recipient = self.listen()
            self.speak("What should be the subject?")
            subject = self.listen()
            self.speak("What should be the body of the email?")
            body = self.listen()
            self.send_email(recipient, subject, body,
                            sender_email, sender_password)
        elif "quit" in command:
            self.speak("Goodbye!")
            exit()
        else:
            self.speak("Sorry, I don't understand that command.")

    def run(self, sender_email, sender_password):
        self.greet_user()
        while True:
            command = self.listen()
            if command:
                self.process_command(command, sender_email, sender_password)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    assistant = Assistant()
    assistant.run("your_email@example.com", "your_email_password")
```

Here are the improvements made:
1. Converted the program into a class -based structure to encapsulate functionality and improve code organization.
2. Improved error handling in the `listen()` function to handle various speech recognition errors and provide appropriate error messages.
3. Used a `with ` statement when sending emails with `smtplib` to ensure proper cleanup of the SMTP connection.
4. Encouraged passing email sender credentials as arguments to the `run()` method instead of hardcoding them in the program for better security and flexibility.

Additionally, you may consider further improvements such as:
1. Adding exception handling for potential errors during web browser opening and file execution.
2. Implementing additional features like playing music, setting reminders, or fetching information from APIs.
3. Creating separate functions or methods for each command in the `process_command()` method to improve readability and maintainability.
4. Implementing error handling for the email sending process, such as validating email addresses and checking for network connectivity.

Remember to periodically update the email sending mechanism to use secure authentication methods if applicable.
